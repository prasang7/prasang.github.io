	<h1 id="abstract">Abstract</h1>
	<p>Built at the National Finals of IBM-RTBI Hackathon, Aurum App aims at improving Healthcare System in Rural India. The problem set given to us was 'Rural India Development' using technology. Since healthcare sector is one of the major domain of Rural India development, we chose this domain. We came to know that there is a lack of medical facilities in remote areas. Even the existing ones are tough to find out. So, we tried to build an app that not only provides helps to the people of Rural India during a medical issue by suggesting remedies, but also helps them to reach the nearby healthcare center.

	<h1 id="abstract">Solution</h1>
	<p>
		Our app posses these basic features:
		<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
			<li>Illness Detector System, that tells you the probable disease based on your symptoms and suggests generic home made remedies.</li>
			<li>Finds nearest healthcare centers within range of 20km.</li>
			<li>Multiple Language Support.</li>
			<li>[Under Construction] In case of an emergency, user can select the healthcenter, and the details of his health conditions (symptoms and probable disease) will be automatically sent to that health center.</li>
			<li>[Under Construction] Everytime a user makes query for a probable disease, his name, geographic location, sex and symptoms will be sent to our server (with prior permissions). Collecting this data from a large userbase and applying data science over it can help us to identify patterns in various disease on geographical scale. This can help in tracking down and prevent any serious disease or epidemic.</li>
		</ul>
