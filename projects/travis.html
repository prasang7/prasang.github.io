	<p><strong>Travis (Traffic Realtime Assistance Via Internet Services):</strong> as the name suggests, is a mobile app that provides real-time assistance to its users (target userbase: drivers, pedestrians & passengers). It is having 4 major modules:
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p><strong>Traffic Feed (Userbase: Drivers, Pedestrians, Passengers):</strong> Users can post anything related to city traffic on the feed in order to inform other about it, this will be visible to everyone. Users can add image and tags in their posts to make their posts more comprehensible. Sample content of feed can be accident alert, traffic jam, congestion alert, or general post.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><strong>Pedestrian Mode (Userbase: Pedestrians):</strong> Activate pedestrian mode while walking on the streets. This will alert you to nearby road intersections, dangers and other hazards related to pedestrian safety. These alerts are given when the user reaches 20m in the range of any potential hazardous geo-location.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><strong>Parking Finder (Drivers):</strong> Parking finder will show you nearby parking spots and the numbers of current free parking spots in the parking in real time. Real-time data is maintained by another supportive application - Travis Parking Assist which I've built. This app will be used by the watchman of the parking spot to update the number of entries of vehicles in the parking.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><strong>Geo Taxi Meter (Passengers):</strong> Geo Taxi Meter helps users to track their route on MAP in real-time while they are traveling. This way they will not get fooled by taxi drivers on taking the wrong route. It also has a fare calculator that calculates fare in real time.</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
