	<h1 id="abstract">Abstract</h1>
	<p>'Violence Against Doctors' is a big social issue which is increasing day by day. If the condition of a 		patient becomes bad, then the relatives of the patient attack violently on the doctors and hospital 		staff. Because of such violence, doctors are afraid of taking emergency cases and treating them as if 		the patient can't be saved, doctors are facing serious damages and getting threats from the patient 		attendants.
		<br>DERT application helps Doctors in case of emergency issues. Only the authentic verified Doctors are authorized to use the app. When the doctor pressess 'emergency Button' in emergency situation, app will send his location, and other details to all the verified Doctors in the community in the form of push notification and sms. </p>

	<h1 id="abstract">Existing Technology</h1>
	<p>Doctor's community in Dehradun used whatsapp group to notify others in the community. Manually typing location details, hospital name and other details takes up a lot of <strong>time</strong>, which is a very crucial factor in emergency situations. With each user having multiple groups on whatsapp, the chances of emergency message being ignored or lost increases substantially.<br>Existing SOS apps are incapable of catering a <strong>large community</strong>, and possess limited application due to internet connection requirements.</p>
